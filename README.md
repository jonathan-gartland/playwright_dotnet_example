# playwright_dotnet_example

until starting this project I hadn't used any .NET - C++, C#, F# - in over 12 years  
which probably shows in the rather simplistic examples  


Anyway this is just a simple Playwright.NET implementation of tests written in Playwright TS for my React Demo App.  

TBH this is clunky compared to writing these tests in JS or Python, but Java would feel clunky too so I guess they
hit their mark.  

To run locally: dotnet test  
or if you're working on a macbook and had to install dotnet as root -> sudo dotnet test
